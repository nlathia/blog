In a dynamic, fast-paced company, there always comes a time when you need to handover something to someone else. That _thing_ could be a project, a system, a team, someone who reports to you, or even an entire role.

In the last couple of years, I have done this several times--mostly because Monzo had grown. I started a regulatory data project because we were a lean _data_ team, and then handed it over to a new colleague who was hired for that area. I started managing some of our new Data Scientists, and then handed some them over as they moved into newly formed teams or domains (and then got some of them back!). For a while, I was the Data Lead for all of Operations, until we hired someone specifically for that role. Most recently, I stepped into a role where I temporarily wore the Product Manager hat in an Engineering squad in order to ship some much-needed core systems work, and inherited and then handed over a system in within one quarter.

Handovers are never easy. There's always some uncertainty. There's always a worry that the quality or pace of the work is somehow going to suffer; that decisions will be rolled back or viewed retrospectively as incorrect. There is definitely an uneasy feeling when handing over a hat or role that has been a big part of your day-to-day (perhaps accompanied with a 'what am I going to be doing next?' feeling). And yet, I have never actually seen any of these worries turn into anything else.

What I have seen more often is that there is a lot of uncertainty with the handover process itself, and it ends up happening too fast or too slow. This is compounded by the fact that multiple handovers may happen at the same time, as you exit one project and enter or start up a different one. Both of these do not set up the folks involved for success: if it happens too fast, the 'new' person is dropped into the deep end; if it happens to slow, the 'old' person ends up doing two jobs for a long time.

Every time that another handover looms, I tend to recall Kevin Goldsmith's talk "Using Agile Techniques to Build a More Inclusive Team" from Lead Dev 2018, which was recommended to me by [@willpillar](https://twitter.com/willpillar).

Although the title doesn't sound like it has much to do with handovers, Kevin describes a four-step process for them - likening it to an kanban board of sorts. I have used this (sometimes explicitly, sometimes just for myself) to smoothen the journey.

Here's how it works. Imagine breaking down all of the things you do as part of the role or project that you are handing over - as if each one were on a post-it. You start out with all of these post-its on the left-most column of a board with the following headers:

1. **You are doing.**
2. **You are onboarding.**
3. **They are offboarding.**
4. **They are doing.**

Moving things over a few at a time.

Showing the balance of responsibilities to keep things clear.
